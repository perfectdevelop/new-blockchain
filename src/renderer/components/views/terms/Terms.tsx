      <h1>OWNERSHIP</h1>
      <p>
        <b>i. You Own the NFT.</b> Each Degen Ape is an NFT on the Solana
        blockchain. When you purchase an NFT, you own the underlying Degen Ape,
        the Art, completely. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the
        Smart Contract and the Solana Network: at no point may we seize, freeze,
        or otherwise modify the ownership of any Degen Ape.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>ii. Personal Use.</b> Subject to your continued compliance with these
        Terms, Degen Academy LLC grants you a worldwide, royalty-free license to
        use, copy, and display the purchased Art, along with any extensions that
        you choose to create or use, solely forthe following purposes: (i) for
        your own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace
        that permits the purchase and sale of your Degen Ape / NFT, provided
        that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Degen Ape owner’s
        rights to display the Art for their Degen Ape to ensure that only the
        actual owner can display the Art; or (iii) as part of a third party
        website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or
        participation of your Degen Ape, provided that the website/application
        cryptographically verifies each Degen Ape owner’s rights to display the
        Art for their Degen Ape to ensure that only the actual owner can display
        the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner
        ofthe Degen Ape leaves the website/application.

        Examples of such Commercial Use would e.g. be the use of the Art to
        produce and sell merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies
        of the Art. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be
        deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that
        permits the use and sale of Degen Apes generally, provided that the

        the owner of the Purchased Degen Ape leaves the website/application; or
